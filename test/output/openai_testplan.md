# Test Plan for IAM Web Pages

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the web pages of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. The goal is to ensure the system functions correctly in terms of security, usability, and performance.

## Objectives

- Validate the functionality and security of the IAM web pages.
- Ensure the usability and accessibility standards are met.
- Verify compatibility across different browsers and devices.
- Test the integration with backend services and databases.

## Scope of Testing

- **Login/Logout Functionality**
- **User Registration/Account Management**
- **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Password Management**
- **Session Management**
- **Audit Logs and Reports**

## Test Items

- Login Page
- Registration Page
- Dashboard
- User Profile Management
- Admin Panel
- Password Reset/Recovery
- Role and Permission Management

## Features to Be Tested

- Correctness of login/logout processes.
- Functionality of user registration.
- Role assignment and permission checks.
- Password encryption and hashing.
- Session expiration and re-authentication prompts.
- Error messages and validations.
- Accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support).

## Features Not to Be Tested

- Backend database performance.
- Detailed network security beyond the UI security checks.
- Internal backend services apart from their integration points with the UI.

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Testing

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Validate each feature against its requirements.

2. **Security Testing**
   - Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.

3. **Usability Testing**
   - Evaluate user experience and ease of use.

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test the application to ensure it handles concurrent users.

5. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Test across different browsers and devices.

6. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensure new updates donâ€™t adversely affect existing functionalities.

### Test Environment

- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android

## Test Data

- Various user roles with different permissions.
- Valid, invalid, and boundary input data.
- Test credentials with different account statuses (active, inactive, locked).

## Schedule

| Activity                | Start Date   | End Date     |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Test Planning           | MM/DD/YYYY   | MM/DD/YYYY   |
| Test Design             | MM/DD/YYYY   | MM/DD/YYYY   |
| Test Environment Setup  | MM/DD/YYYY   | MM/DD/YYYY   |
| Test Execution          | MM/DD/YYYY   | MM/DD/YYYY   |
| Test Closure            | MM/DD/YYYY   | MM/DD/YYYY   |
