Creating a comprehensive test plan for the web pages of an IAM (Identity and Access Management) system is a critical step to ensure the system is secure, reliable, and functions correctly. Below is an outline of a detailed test plan focusing on the key aspects of IAM systems.
    
    ### Test Plan for IAM System Web Pages
    
    #### 1. **Introduction**
    
    - **Objective**: Validate the functionality, security, performance, and usability of the IAM web pages.
    - **Scope**: Includes all web pages related to user management, authentication, authorization, auditing, and policy management within the IAM system.
    - **Assumptions**: Test environment set up with necessary access permissions.
    - **Constraints**: Testing performed on supported browsers and platforms only.
    
    #### 2. **Test Items**
    
    - User Registration and Management (sign-up, profile management)
    - Authentication (login, logout)
    - Authorization (role assignment, permissions)
    - Password Management (reset, recovery, complexity rules)
    - MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) configuration
    - Session Management (timeouts, session persistence)
    - Auditing and Logging (tracking, history)
    - Policy Management (create, update, delete access policies)
    
    #### 3. **Features to be Tested**
    
    - **Functional Testing**
      - User registration and management: Verify user sign-up, profile updates, and deletion.
      - Authentication mechanisms: Validate login via username/password and alternative methods (e.g., OAuth, SAML).
      - Authorization processes: Ensure correct role assignment and access controls.
      
    - **Security Testing**
      - Verify protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).
      - Test password policies and their enforcement.
      - Evaluate the effectiveness of multi-factor authentication.
      
    - **Usability Testing**
      - Ensure the UI is intuitive and provides helpful feedback.
      - Assess accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG guidelines).
      
    - **Performance Testing**
      - Load test authentication and user management pages.
      - Stress test against concurrent user sessions.
    
    - **Compatibility Testing**
      - Test across various browsers and devices.
    
    #### 4. **Features Not to be Tested**
    
    - Third-party authentication services not integrated directly.
    - Internal admin dashboard features for backend administration.
    
    #### 5. **Test Approach**
    
    - **Manual Testing**: Execute functional and usability test cases manually.
    - **Automated Testing**: Use tools like Selenium to automate regression and performance tests.
    - **Security Testing**: Use tools like OWASP
